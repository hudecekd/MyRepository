- Check that DateTime is used right (UTC, local etc.). That for example local DateTime
  is not being compared aginst UTC DateTime and so on.
- save setting when Suspend occurs otherwise all alarm settings
  go missing for some reason.
- save settings to roaming so I know how to use roaming correctly?
- handle main back button
- how to hide "back button" if we go from alarm not by back button but by selectin different tab???
- navigation history is not correct when app is launched by toast so
  back button does not work correctly! It does not return to "main alrm page"
  but to "main page".
- change layout when orientation of display changes
